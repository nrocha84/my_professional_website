    comment: "I had the privilege of knowing Nic both personally and professionally for over eight years. During that time I have not come across a more caring and compassionate person. Nic truly cares about those surrounding him and it shows in his work. He is always willing to go the extra mile to help a teammate accomplish a task or goal. The care he takes can also be found in the timeliness of his follow through and attention to detail in the delivery of his work product. It goes without saying that Nic is the consummate team player and will bring with him an enthusiasm and excitement to succeed that any organization would be lucky to have."
